  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a supporting library for the Apache web server. It provides a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that map to the underlying Operating System (OS). Where the OS doesn't support a particular function, APR will provide an emulation. Thus programmers can use the APR to make a program portable across different platforms.
  Installed Program: apr-1-config
  Installed Library: libapr-1.so
  Installed Directories: /usr/include/apr-1 and /usr/share/apr-1
  Short Descriptions
    apr-1-config: is a shell script used to retrieve information about the apr library in the system. It is typically used to compile and link against the library
